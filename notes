Animation can only play after block was placed! 
There is no reason to make system which animates and plays at the same time!

Block falling, 
control and draw it
block baked
now if there is solved lines or other special events then animate and play them
then drop a new block once animation is done!!!
This makes so much more sense!!!

What did I learn from it? Don't overcomplicate, instead of designing most robust
system ever think of the actual usecase to design scope better! This is so much
more easier then the other way I was doing it!!!

Each placed tetrimo adds coins, combos add more coins
There is a timer of ticks depleating coins every X time, every time cost is more
Play wins if he does enough damage by some action?
Other action leads to coins to win more time


Spawn 
Fall 
Burn
Animate
Repeat
